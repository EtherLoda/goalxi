/**
 * WAVE A1 — youth-structure bootstrap.
 *
 * For every senior `league`, ensure exactly one `youth_league` exists
 * (1:1 mapping by `senior_league_id`). For every senior `team`,
 * ensure exactly one `youth_team` exists (1:1 mapping by `team_id`).
 *
 * Both creations are idempotent: the generator no-ops if the link row
 * already exists, so re-running `BootstrapService.onModuleInit` after
 * a fresh migration is safe.
 *
 * Order of operations: this MUST run after `LeagueGenerator` and
 * `TeamGenerator` (so the senior rows exist) and BEFORE
 * `ScheduleGenerator` (so the schedule generator can resolve
 * `youth_team.teamId → senior team`).
